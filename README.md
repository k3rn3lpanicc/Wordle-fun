# Wordle-fun
A random project for solving wordle

## How to run?

Enter the root folder of the project, hit `npm i` to install packages needed, then you can run:

The code would ask you which word you have entered as the openning word on worlde, and after you reply with your word, it would help you find the answer base on the information you got in each round.
